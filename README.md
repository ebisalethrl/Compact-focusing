# Compact-focusing

This folder containts various files for designing a compact focusing system using an active plasma lens, based on the CLEAR beamline at CERN, and using the tool CLEARview by Kyrre Ness Sjøbæk. 

The files NOAPL_OPTIMIZATION.ipynb, APL_BACKPROP.ipynb, APL_OPTIMIZATION.ipynb and MATCHING.ipynb are all jupyter notebooks where optimizations are run to find optimal quadrupole currents to focus a beam in given focus points. The file Visualize_final.ipynb is a tool to visualize all plots by reading from excel-files.
